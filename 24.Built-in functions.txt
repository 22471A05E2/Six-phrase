24. Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it, 
you can read document online or find some books. But Python has a built-in 
document function for every built-in functions.
Please write a program to print some Python built-in functions documents, 
such as abs(), int(), raw_input()
And add document for your own function

print abs._doc_
print int._doc_
print raw_input._doc_

def square(num):
    
    return num ** 2

print square(2)
print square._doc_

Output:
4
