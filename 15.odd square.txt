15. Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is 
input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers. Suppose the following 
input is supplied to the program:
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
Then, the output should be:
1,9,25,49,81

numbers = input("Type in: ")
numbers = numbers.split(',')
odd_list = [i*i for i in numbers.split(',') if (int(i) % 2 != 0)]
print((" ").join(odd_list))

Output:
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
1,9,25,49,81
