55. Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have a area function which can print the area of the shape where Shape's area is 0 by 
default.

class Shape(object):
    def _init_(self):
        pass

    def area(self):
        return 0

class Square(Shape):
    def _init_(self, l):
        Shape._init_(self)
        self.length = l

    def area(self):
        return self.length*self.length

aSquare= Square(3)
print aSquare.area()
